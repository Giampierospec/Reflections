When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you want a project to be seen by other people, so they can help you achieve a better result

  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because if you save then manually you have more control over them.
