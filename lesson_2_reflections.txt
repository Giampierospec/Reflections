What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a new instance of the directory, and you need to do it in order to make sure the repository was created
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area is an intermediate between the commit and the working directory, it offers security
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
    You just introduce what is the logical change you should use.
    What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
        When you need two different versions of the same app, and it would help keep your code more organized

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It makes me read them graphically
