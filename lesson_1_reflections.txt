Well it let me see in a more ordered manner how typos can make your whole app crash
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
A- It can show me what errors i might have done that should affect my code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
That you are in control and save what matters to you instead of the auto-save feature.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because i suppose  it's easier for him to do it

 git diff f19cb1b80fe27e938e4d72770ca0a42f25e99ecc
 b0678b161fcf74467ed3a63110557e3d6229cfa6
 How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
 to see the difference between those two files to see which elements were added and which were deleted
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?It makes  me see a clever way to search for errors instead of visiting each line of code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for? To search for errors in every version of my code.
